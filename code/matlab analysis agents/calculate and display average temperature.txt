%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Read the last hour of temperature data from a ThingSpeak channel and
% write the average temperature to Field 6 in another (or the same) channel.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

%=== 1. Specify the channel and field for reading
readChannelID = 2788564;   % Channel ID to read data from
tempFieldID   = 5;         % Field storing temperature data

% If your read channel is private, enter its Read API Key here
% (If the channel is public, you can leave this empty)
readAPIKey    = '7TWNECS2YKLTSL4Y';  

%=== 2. Read the past 60 minutes of temperature data from Field 5
tempData = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID, ...
    'Fields',    tempFieldID, ...
    'NumMinutes',60, ...
    'ReadKey',   readAPIKey);

if isempty(tempData)
    disp('No temperature data retrieved.');
    % You can decide what to do here. For example:
    % return;  % Exit if no data was found
    % or set a default value for avgTemp:
    avgTemp = 0; 
    disp('Setting average temperature to 0 because no data was found.');
else
    %=== 3. Calculate the average temperature
    avgTemp = mean(tempData);
    
    % Check if the average is NaN (e.g., if the data was all NaN)
    if isnan(avgTemp)
        % If it's NaN, choose a fallback value
        avgTemp = 25;
        disp('Mean is NaN. Setting average temperature to 0.');
    else
        disp(['Average Temperature = ', num2str(avgTemp), 'Â°C']);
    end
end

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 4. Write the average temperature to a *different* channel OR the same one
%    in Field 6.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Replace with the channel ID where you want to write the average temperature
% (It could be the same as readChannelID or a different channel.)
writeChannelID = 2788564; 

% Enter your Write API Key for the channel above
writeAPIKey = 'YS1VTTDPFVKTT0G0';

% Write the average temperature to Field 6
thingSpeakWrite(writeChannelID, ...
                'Fields',   6, ...
                'Values',   avgTemp, ...
                'WriteKey', writeAPIKey);

disp('Successfully wrote average temperature to Field 6.');
